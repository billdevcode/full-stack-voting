# full-stack-voting

### Test-First Development with Redux, React and Immutable

####
This project is a voting app where multiple users can connect and vote between 2 choices at a time. The most voted item gets pushed back to the list of items and voting ends when there is only 1 item remaining. The results will show the total votes for each item.   

Other technologies used: Node, Webpack, Babel, Chai, and Socket.io
