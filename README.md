# full-stack-voting

### Test-First Development with Redux, React and Immutable

####
This project is a decoupled voting app where multiple users can connect and vote between 2 choices. The most voted item goes back to the list of items and ends when there is only 1 item left. The results will show the total votes for each item.   

Other technologies used: Node, Webpack, Babel, Chai, and Socket.io
